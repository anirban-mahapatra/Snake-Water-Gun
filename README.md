## Overview
This project is a simple and fun game of Snake Water Gun, also known as Rock Paper Scissors in some cultures. The game is played against the computer.

### The Challenge
The challenge was to implement a game with a simple user interface that can randomly select between Snake, Water, and Gun, and then compare it with the user's choice to decide who wins.

## My Process

### Built With
- Python: The entire game is built with Python, using the `random` module to enable the computer to randomly choose between Snake, Water, and Gun.

### What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to use Python's `random` module, how to take user input, and how to implement game logic to determine the winner.

### Continued Development
In the future, I plan to enhance this game by adding a graphical user interface (GUI) and improving the game dynamics by introducing more elements.

### Useful Resources
- Python Official Documentation: The official Python documentation was very helpful in understanding how to use the `random` module.
